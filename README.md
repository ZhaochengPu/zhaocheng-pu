I am a Computer Science student at De Anza College. 
My academic goal is to transfer to UC Berkeley or San Jose State University as a Computer Science student and conduct research in university labs and write CS essays. 
I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
My career goal is to find an internship and then transition to a full-time job.
